I am a sophomore CS student in Govt. Model Engineering College. I'm a passionate coder, chess player, blogger and a technical speaker. I like to stay in tune with the latest technologies through continued learning and development. I aspire to become a Fullstack Software Engineer.

I love to play chess both [online](https://lichess.org/@/pranavmodx) and on [board](http://ratings.fide.com/profile/45034958). It rejuvenates my mind and improves my focus and concentration. Challenge me anytime for a game! ;)

I also like reading books - crime, detective, mystery and science fiction; and non fiction for self improvement. Some of my favourite authors are HG Wells, Dan Brown and Dale Carnegie.

Besides these, I enjoy listening to music. I shuffle between calm and soothing music and energetic pop and psychedelic rock music. Some of my favourite bands are Linkin Park, Pink Floyd, Tame Impala, The Weeknd and White Moth Black Butterfly!
