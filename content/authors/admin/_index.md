I am a sophomore CS student in Govt. Model Engineering College. I'm a passionate coder, chess player, blogger and a technical speaker. I like to stay in tune with the latest technologies through continued learning and development. I aspire to become a Fullstack Software Engineer.

I love to play chess both [online](https://lichess.org/@/pranavmodx) and on [board](http://ratings.fide.com/profile/45034958). It rejuvenates my mind and improves my focus and concentration. Hit me up anytime for a game! ;)

I also like reading books - crime, detective, mystery and science fiction; and non fiction for self improvement. Some of my favourite authors are HG Wells, Dan Brown and Dale Carnegie.
